All data science projects showcased here are a testament to my personal growth, academic endeavors, and passion for data analysis and machine learning as a hobby. 
These projects span across various categories, including but not limited to;
machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization, each representing my commitment to continuous learning, exploration, and practical application of data science techniques.

Machine Learning:
Mini or Micro Projects:
â€¢	Simple Linear Regression: A project demonstrating the application of simple linear regression, a fundamental machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable.
â€¢	Multiple Linear Regression: An implementation of multiple linear regression, a technique used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable.
â€¢	Polynomial Regression: A project showcasing polynomial regression, a regression technique that models the relationship between the independent and dependent variables as an nth-degree polynomial.
â€¢	Support Vector Regression: An example of support vector regression, a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict continuous outcomes.
â€¢	Waiter Tips Prediction Model: A practical application of linear regression for predicting waiter tips based on various factors such as total bill amount, party size, etc.
â€¢	Real Estate Price Prediction Model: A project demonstrating the development of a predictive model for real estate prices using regression analysis.
Data Analysis:
ï‚§	Exploratory Data Analysis using the Titanic Dataset: An analysis of the Titanic dataset, exploring various factors that may have influenced survival rates among passengers on the Titanic.
ï‚§	Life Expectancy Analysis: An examination of factors affecting life expectancy across different countries, utilizing demographic and health-related data.
ï‚§	Stock Market Analysis: An analysis of stock market data to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing stock prices.
Data Visualization:
â€¢	Exploring Diamond Characteristics: Insights from the Seaborn Diamonds Dataset: A visualization project exploring various characteristics of diamonds, such as carat weight, cut quality, and price, using the Seaborn library.
â€¢	Exploring Penguin Diversity: Insights from the Seaborn Penguin Dataset: A visualization project analyzing the diversity of penguin species based on features such as bill length, bill depth, and flipper length.
â€¢	Simple Data Visualization Project: A project showcasing basic data visualization techniques to represent and interpret data effectively.

Each project provides hands-on experience with different aspects of machine learning, data analysis, and data visualization
